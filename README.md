## Scarlet App

Scarlet for iOS 16 - iOS 17 is a new on-device IPA installer designed for Apple devices. Built with advanced technologies from AltStore and SideStore, Scarlet lets you sign and install IPA files using your Apple ID and password. Enjoy the convenience of a 7-day free certificate, though a PC connection is required.

For a seamless installation on jailed devices without a PC, Scarlet offers multiple options including IPA, TrollStore, weblink, and the ScarletCloud installer for Desktop.

Scarlet iOS features a simple, uncluttered user interface. Upon opening, you'll find a list of default Scarlet Repo apps ready for download. Simply click to download, and the app will be signed and installed automatically.

## Scarlet IPA Installer

Scarlet iOS is a powerful tool for installing third-party apps on your iDevice, featuring robust support for a wide range of sources. With a preinstalled list of jailbreak tools, ++ apps, and emulators, it’s easy to download and install these apps on your device.

Refreshing installed IPA files is simple, and you can run JIT mode for supported apps. Just-In-Time compilation allows apps to be natively compiled on the device for full-speed performance. For example, Delta JIT compilation can double the Fast Forward speed from 1.5x to 3x, ensuring lightning-fast performance with no lag.

## Direct Install Scarlet App

Installing Scarlet iOS from the weblink comes with an enterprise certificate, allowing you to install apps and sign IPA files without needing to refresh them every 7 days. However, Apple may revoke this certificate. If this happens, you can go to the Settings app and enable “Disable Anti-Blacklist” in the Scarlet preference pane to reverse the state.

## ScarletCloud for Desktop

If other methods don’t work, try ScarletCloud. This desktop tool, available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, allows you to install Scarlet on your iPhone or iPad using your Apple ID to sign and install IPA files.

Note: A cable connection to the PC is required for signing files, which can be a drawback. Despite this, ScarletCloud is a valuable alternative when other installation methods are not feasible. It supports all devices on iOS 13 – iOS 16 and iOS 17.

## How to Install Scarlet IPA for iOS

To install Scarlet IPA on iOS 15, iOS 16, or iOS 17 using ScarletCloud for Desktop, follow these steps:

1. Open ScarletCloud and install Scarlet onto your device.
2. Install WireGuard VPN Tunnel app from the App Store.
3. Import the Scarlet Configuration File into the WireGuard app.

6. Enable the Scarlet Configuration File in the WireGuard app.
7. Open the Scarlet app from your Home Screen.
8. Import IPA files or install available apps from the repo.

Scarlet resigns apps with your personal development certificate and uses a specially designed VPN to trick iOS into installing them. Scarlet IPA includes a custom certificate to sign IPA files on your device and provides a Developer login option.

# How to Install IPA with Scarlet App

To sign IPA files using your Apple ID and a free developer account, open ScarletCloud Beta to ensure proper installation of Scarlet apps on your device.

In the future, adding the ability to sign IPA files over Wi-Fi or without a PC would enhance Scarlet's usability, similar to SideStore, offering more flexibility and convenience for users installing their favorite apps on iOS devices.

**Tip:** Scarlet iOS 16 can read Cydia Repos, providing access to a list of available packages. This feature allows you to install certain apps without tweak injection or an active jailbreak, streamlining the process.
